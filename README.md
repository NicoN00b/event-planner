#### _{This is a simple Java program to estimate the cost of an event}, {8.4.17}_

#### By _**{Nicholas Raethke}**_

## Description

This program works with the BufferedReader in Java to allow a User to choose food, beverages, and entertainment for a set number of people, and have an estimated cost returned.  Additionally, it can except one of two discount codes.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

If you would like to view this program.l  Please fork it and open in a Java compatible IDE (I used IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition).  If you run App.java, it will mostly work.  I worked on this with gradle and some imported Java libraries that should be visible at the top of  App.java and Event.java 

## Known Bugs

_{This APP.java is neither refactored to an acceptable level or working with full functionality.  It can only return a single value for each variable (three of them should be ArrayLists).}_

## Support and contact details

_{Message me here on github}_

## Technologies Used

_{As stated earlier, I used IntelliJ IDEA with gradle to build this, my first independent try with Java}_
